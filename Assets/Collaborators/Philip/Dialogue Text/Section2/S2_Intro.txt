2“Great. You reached the core of my laboratory.”
2“Now all you gotta do is open that vault door in front of you and head on through.” 
1“Gee, Cecil. I know we’re friends and all but don’t ya think ordering me around on a loudspeaker is a bit cold?”
2“You want me to hire a receptionist for you?”
1“Well, it doesn’t have to be a receptionist, but having one of your assistants welcome me in would have been nice.” 
2“D’aww. Feeling a bit lonely out there?”
1“I guess I just expected to meet somebody by now.” 
2“Maybe you will meet somebody on this floor.” 
2“Although I’d actually suggest turning tail and running away if you make contact with one of them.” 
1“By them I hope you’re just talking about your assistants.”
2“Good one.”

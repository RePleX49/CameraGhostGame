1"Sweet--I made it to the elevator."
1"Now where will this take me?"
2"Hey, you actually came."
1"Huh?"
1"But this is Cecil’s lab we’re talking about."
1"C-Cecil?"
1"Cecil, is that you on the speakers??"
2"Yep. It’s me."
1"Cecil, are you okay?"
1"Where are you?"
1"And what’s this ‘accident’ you were talking about in your letter?"
1"Why is this place empty? What was that portal thing down there? What’s this camera I’m holding right now?"
1"What is going on in this place??"
2"I understand things are confusing right now."
2"But I promise to explain everything later."
2"You trust me, right?"
2"Right now, I need you to take the elevator and come find me."
1"Cecil. Just let me know if you’re okay first."
2"Find me."
2"You’ll see for yourself."
1"Cecil?"
1"Cecil!"
1"Oh come on--did he really just leave me like that?"
1"God, he’s always been so difficult to work with."
1"I guess I have no choice but to keep moving forward though."

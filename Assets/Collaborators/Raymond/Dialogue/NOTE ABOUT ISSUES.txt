-Currently, the portals don't appear under the "Appear" or "Disappear" tab in the DisappearParent.

-Trying to change the order seems to do nothing either. For the added dialogue boxes,
right now they are still unable to play but I'm assuming that's because of the current array set up
in the Event Manager. I didn't change just because I tried to previously and it gave me errors,
so it is currently still at 7, while there are 9 textBoxManagers in the scene.
